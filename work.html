              Code for Ghana is part of the Code for Africa initiative which aims to use open
              data and technology to promote responsive, innovative and effective governance.
              Code for Ghana follows in the tradition of Code for Kenya and Code for South Africa
              by embedding software developers and data fellows in media organisations for a period of
              six months. During this period, the Data Fellows and Developers are expected to work with
              their host organisations on open data projects. Code for Ghana is jointly funded by the
              African Innovative News Challenge and Making All Voices Count with support from the Webfoundation
